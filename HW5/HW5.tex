\begin{homeworkProblem}
See attached page for drawings on XYZ coordinate frames on each link.
\begin{description}
  \item[$\Theta_1$] Rotation about $Z_0$ from $X_0$ to $X_1$. $\theta_1$ on the manipulator.
  \item[$d_1$] Distance from $O_0$ to the intersection of $Z_0$ and $Z_1$ ($O_1$) along $Z_0$. Defined as L1.
  \item[$a_1$] Distance along $X_1$ to get to $O_1$. 0, there is no common normal because $Z_0$ and $Z_1$ intersect.
  \item[$\alpha_1$] Rotation about $X_1$ to align $Z_0$ to $Z_1$. Immediately appears to be $-90^o$, but since $X_1$ is defined as into the page it is $90^o$.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
  \item[$\Theta_2$] Rotation about $Z_1$ from $X_1$ to $X_2$ (ccw). $\theta_2$ on the manipulator.
  \item[$d_2$] Distance from $O_1$ to the intersection of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ ($O_2$) along $Z_1$.
  \item[$a_2$] Distance along $X_2$ to get to $O_2$. 0, there is no common normal because $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ intersect.
  \item[$\alpha_2$] Rotation about $X_2$ to align $Z_1$ to $Z_2$. Immediately appears to be $90^o$, but since $X_2$ is defined as into the page it is $-90^o$.
\end{description}

\begin{description}
  \item[$\Theta_3$] Rotation about $Z_2$ from $X_2$ to $X_3$ (ccw). $-90^o$ to align $X_2$ to $X_3$ ($n$).
  \item[$d_3$] Distance from $O_2$ to the intersection of $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ ($O_3$). $S_3$ since this is the prismatic joint.
  \item[$a_3$] Distance along $X_3$ to get to $O_3$. 0, there is no common normal because $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ lie on top of each other.
  \item[$\alpha_3$] Rotation about $X_3$ to align $Z_2$ to $Z_3$. 0. $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ point in the same direction.
\end{description}

All together the parameters for each of the the different joints are as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{c | c | c | c | c }
 & $\Theta_i$ & $d_i$ & $a_i$ & $\alpha_i$ \\
\hline
1 & $\theta_1$ & $L_1$ & 0 & $90^o$ \\
2 & $\theta_2$ & $d_2$ & 0 & $-90^o$ \\
3 & $-90^o$ & $S_3$ & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Substituting these into the DH matrix given in the notes the individual transformation matrices can be generated.
\input{params1}
This manipulator transform is not the same as the one as found from the other method because the variables are defined slightly different and since the link coordinate axes are not the exact same. 

As drawn $\theta_1$ from the DH matrix is actually $\theta_1'+90^o$ where $\theta_1'$ is the angle as defined in the previous homework. This is because for the $\Theta_1$ rotation (as drawn) $X_1$ actually points into the page. So if the manipulator is shown with all angles in the zero position, the DH $\theta_1$ is actually at $90^0$.

This can be verified by substituting in the below variables in. The correct orientation should be an identity matrix (identical to $X_0$, $Y_0$, and $Z_0$). The position of the end effector should be $P_x=d_2$,  $P_y=0$, $P_z=L_1+S_3$, which is what is shown below
\input{params2}
