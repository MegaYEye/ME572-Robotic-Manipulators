\begin{homeworkProblem}
Using Cramer's rule to solve for each of the equations you get the general solution below:
\begin{eqnarray}
\input{soln}
\end{eqnarray}

The equation will divide by zero when $S_2$ is 0. This can also be found by just looking at the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, $-S_2$. The Jacobian for $S_2=0$ with the angles remaining the same is shown below. Attempting to take the determinant of it with Matlab results in very large numbers and Matlab complaining about a singularity. The Jacobian will not work when $S_2=0$.

\begin{eqnarray}
J&=&\begin{bmatrix}
3.43&-0.50&1.93\\ 
4.90&-0.87&2.30\\ 
1.00&0.00&1.00\\ 
\end{bmatrix} \\
J^{-1}&=&\begin{bmatrix}
-1501199875790165.25&866718152394885.75&903024166285322.75\\
